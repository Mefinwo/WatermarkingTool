# WatermarkingTool
## Description
This tool is used to add a watermark of your choice onto a single picture or a folder full of pictures.
## Installation
After cloning the newest version of the repository open a terminal and type the following command: 
```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
After following the instructions in "Installation" you can now start the ``main.py`` file. Now click the browse button in the GUI and navigate to the folder with the .png and .jpg files. 

I would like to apologize for the fact that there is no real guidance throughout the program, but the program is still in its early stages.

After entering the folder you will be prompted to enter a .png file that will be used as the watermark. In the folder of the project there will then be a .zip fodler containing all the watermarked images.
